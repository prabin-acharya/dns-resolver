# DNS Resoler

DNS Resolver is a lightweight DNS client implemented in Go. It is designed to send DNS queries to a DNS server and decode the responses. The project demonstrates how to construct DNS messages, send them over the network, and parse the responses according to the DNS protocol specifications (RFC 1035).
